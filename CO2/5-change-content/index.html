        Football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of
        their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the
        goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The
        team that scores more goals wins.

        Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple in its
        principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from
        fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the
        Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there
        were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a
        combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial
        month-long World Cup finals.
