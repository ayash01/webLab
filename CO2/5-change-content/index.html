        Football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of
        their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the
        goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The
        team that scores more goals wins.
        <br><br>
        Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple in its
        principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from
        fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the
        Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there
        were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a
        combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial
        month-long World Cup finals.

        Cricket, is played throughout the world, particularly in Australia, India, Pakistan, the West Indies, and the
        British Isles. Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing teams of 11 players. The field
        is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards by 10 feet wide. Two sets of
        three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of each wicket lie
        horizontal pieces called bails.
        <br><br>
        The sides take turns at batting and bowling(pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural).
        Sides have one or two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the
        match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to
        break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is
        dismissed, or put out.A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket, then a different player from his side bowls six
        balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket.
